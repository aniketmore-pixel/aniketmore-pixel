### Hi there 👋  

My name is Aniket More, an IT Engineering student passionate about building scalable apps and solving real-world problems with code! 🚀

- 🛒 I recently built **[CustomTees](https://github.com/aniketmore-pixel/CustomTees)** – an end-to-end e-commerce platform where artists can sell custom T-shirts with real-time 3D customization.
- 🌱 I’m exploring full-stack development, cloud computing (AWS), and making ML projects.
- 🤝 I’m always looking to collaborate.
